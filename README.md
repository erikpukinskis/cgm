## Development

### Updating types

Re-generate our DSLs (after adding routes, etc.)

```sh
bin/tapioca dsl
```

Update types from a specific gem:

```sh
bin/tapioca gem actionmailer
```


## Todo

 - [ ] The Sign In page doesn't do any error handling. Need to follow the same pattern we use on Join Page
 - [ ] Need auth on the API!!!
 - [ ] Should obfuscate user ids with hashid
 - [ ] Might be nice to add [mission_control-jobs](https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs) for observability
