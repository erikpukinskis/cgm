## Getting started

```sh

bin/dev
```

## Documentation

Docs are at http://localhost:3000/docs, generated by [OasRails](https://a-chacon.com/oas_rails/).

## LLM Chat Summaries

I was only able to export [one](public/cursor.md) of my many Cursor chat tabs. Was getting [this error](public/cursor-chat-browser-error.png) in cursor-chat-browser for most of the chats. Also note that the markdown generated by cursor-chat-browser is kind of broken, because of markdown in the chats.

## Development

### Updating types

Re-generate our DSLs (after adding routes, etc.)

```sh
bin/tapioca dsl
```

Update types from a specific gem:

```sh
bin/tapioca gem actionmailer
```


## Todo

 - [ ] The Sign In page doesn't do any error handling. Need to follow the same pattern we use on Join Page
 - [ ] Need auth on the API!!!
 - [ ] Should obfuscate user ids with hashid
 - [ ] Might be nice to add [mission_control-jobs](https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs) for observability
