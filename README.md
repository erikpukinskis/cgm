## LLM Chat Summaries

I was only able to export [one](public/cursor.md) of my many Cursor chat tabs. Was getting [this error](public/cursor-chat-browser-error.png) in cursor-chat-browser for most of the chats. Also note that the markdown generated by cursor-chat-browser is kind of broken, because of markdown in the chats.

## Architecture

TODO(erik): Document:
 - [ ] How the job queue works with polling
 - [ ] Non-standard gems used
 - [ ] Authentication flow
 - [ ] Strategy for forms + Turbo
 - [ ] Caching strategy
 - [ ] CSS setup
 - [ ] Documentation ([OasRails](https://a-chacon.com/oas_rails/))

## Development

### Updating types

Re-generate our DSLs (after adding routes, etc.)

```sh
bin/tapioca dsl
```

Update types from a specific gem:

```sh
bin/tapioca gem actionmailer
```

## Todo

 - [ ] The .beginning_of_hour rounding we use for metric caching is going to maximize cache hits, but won't work if we want up-to-the-minute metrics.
 - [ ] Didn't get to the "calculate the change in each metric from the prior period" requirement
 - [ ] The Sign In page doesn't do any error handling. Need to follow the same pattern we use on Join Page
 - [ ] Need auth on the API
 - [ ] Should obfuscate user ids with hashid
 - [ ] Might be nice to add [mission_control-jobs](https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs) for observability
 - [ ] Add types in more places (tests would be a place to start)
 - [ ] Can we type check .erb files?
 - [ ] Remove unused gems and empty boilerplate (home_helper, etc)
