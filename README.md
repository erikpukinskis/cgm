## Getting started

```sh
bundle install
bin/dev
```

## Documentation

Docs are at http://localhost:3000/docs, generated by [OasRails](https://a-chacon.com/oas_rails/).

## Updating types

Re-generate our DSLs (after adding routes, etc.)

```sh
bin/tapioca dsl
```

Update types from a specific gem:

```sh
bin/tapioca gem actionmailer
```

## Debugging

Open the database for querying

```sh
sqlite3 storage/development.sqlite3
```

## Todo

 - Might be nice to add [mission_control-jobs](https://github.com/rails/mission_control-jobs) for observability
